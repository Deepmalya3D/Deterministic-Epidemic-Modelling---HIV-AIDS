# Deterministic Epidemic Modelling - HIV/AIDS
As a part of my undergraduate dissertation, I decided to work on Epidemic Modelling focusing on HIV/AIDS with visualizations and its application to real-life scenarios. In this paper, we've discussed SIS, SIR, SEIR, and SIRS models and analyzed the key mechanics behind each model and how they correlate with real-world epidemics. We've also used the most direct approach to predict AIDS cases using HIV transmission dynamical models. Using the model under consideration we've used python to visualize, test, and fit our model with real-life scenarios and predict future trends. We've also discussed the scope and limitations of our study and how we may overcome them. Finally, we made estimates of potential outbreak casualties for new initial conditions and modern outbreak controls.
